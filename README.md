Citation Based Impact of Bioinformatics Conferences (published: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa071)

I was able to compare several popular bioinformatics conference citations datasets for ranking and statistical analysis. This included the calculation of p-values matrices, bootstrapping, hierarchical clustering using multiple distance metrics, and data visualizations utilizing confidence intervals. All results have been compiled into a reserach paper which is now published in the Bioinformatics journal.

t-SNE Modification

I also had some time to learn about the t-SNE algorithm; a dimensionality reduction algorithm. The intention of ths project was to modify/reimplment it with a different distance metric developed by the lab I  was working in.
