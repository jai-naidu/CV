# Data Science Intern - Khoury College of Computer Science

January 2019 - August 2019

Citation Based Impact of Bioinformatics Conferences (published: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa071)

I was able to compare several popular bioinformatics conference citations datasets for ranking and statistical analysis. This included the calculation of p-values matrices, bootstrapping, hierarchical clustering using multiple distance metrics, and data visualizations utilizing confidence intervals. All results have been compiled into a reserach paper which is now published in the Bioinformatics journal.

t-SNE Modification

I also had some time to learn about the t-SNE algorithm; a dimensionality reduction algorithm which maps multi-dimensional datasets to lower dimension (2D) visualizations. The intention of ths project was to modify/reimplment it with a different distance metric developed by the lab I  was working in. This involved the actual reimplentation and the development of my understanding of stochastic neighbor embedding.

# Software Developer Intern - Accolade Inc. (NASDAQ: ACCD)
-code unavailable-

June 2019 - August 2018

I had the opportunity to develop a CLI tool that streamlined the data ingestion process by allowing secure third-party access to backend datastores. This involed familiarizing myself with AWS and the S3 data storage service, libraries such as boto3 and argparse, authorization frameworks (OAuth2), and HTTPS protocols. The CLI tool was able to grant a third-party user with a token that allows very limited and secure access to Accolade's S3 data stores to execute simple data management queries.

# CEL Animation Software

May 2020 - June 2020

I developed a basic animation software that is capable of live editing (adding, deleting, moving, etc. objects), layer management, scrubbing, speed control, in-application visualization and exporting (to .SVG). Tweening and model-view-controller methodologies informed the design of the software. The program was fully unit tested using JUnit4.
